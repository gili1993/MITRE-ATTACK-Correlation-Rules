# MITRE ATT&CK Correlation Rules and Playbooks

This repository provides resources and guidance on building correlation rules and playbooks using the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** for web applications and MySQL databases. It includes examples, methodologies, and best practices to enhance detection mechanisms and automate response processes.

## Overview

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversarial tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides valuable insights for strengthening detection and response mechanisms.

This repository includes:
- **Correlation Rules**: Step-by-step instructions to detect specific attack techniques, such as SQL injections and privilege escalation attempts.
- **Playbooks**: Automated response workflows to mitigate threats like data exfiltration.
